Trip with dates
Stages with dates
¿Stages whithin stages? ¿POI Point of interests?
Differences between Cruise & European Tour (Brugge Staget between two Brussels)

Think about the way to introduce data. There are so much cases.

Use Leaflet instead of openlayers? Is a replace or similar?

Examine what type of date works better with angularjs (datetime)

Is a good idea to create markdown editor to this app like odyssey one?

Prepopulate Geopoints database to everyone (Countries/Capitals)

TDD (Trips name for  Adventures name?)
- La Antilla (Adventure with only one location - no stages)
- Cerecera (Adventure one place two stages)
- Cruise (Adventures with some stages)
- European Tour (Adventures with stages with pois)

If I test an Object like "Adventure", can I use it with angularjs without problems or is better to create a prototype in angularjs
